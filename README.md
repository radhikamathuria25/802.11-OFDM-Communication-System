# 802.11-OFDM-Communication-System
An end-to-end OFDM communication system based on the 802.11-2007 standard as a part of a mini-project for a graduate course on Modern Communication Networks at UCSD. Modules implemented:

- Packet construction and OFDM modulation
- Packet transmission and channel distortion
- Packet detection (using STF)
- Packet synchronisation (using STF)
- Channel estimation and packet decoding (using LTF)
